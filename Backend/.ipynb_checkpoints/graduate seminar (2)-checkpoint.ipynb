Initially proposed in 2018, the project has faced delays and revisions, but with city approval now secured, the ambitious development is finally moving forward.\",\"P: The Foundry is expected to be a culinary and social hub, featuring a mix of specialty food vendors, restaurants, and possibly a brewery and wine bar in additional buildings set around the courtyard. While exact details remain under wraps, early renderings suggest a concept similar to Eataly, the popular Italian food hall with locations in San Jose and other major cities. Visitors can likely expect an expansive selection of international cuisine, fresh market goods, and artisanal beverages.\",\"P: The development will be located on the vacant lot across from the Walnut Creek movie theater at 1250 Locust Street / 1501 Mount Diablo Boulevard. The two-story structure will also include an outdoor courtyard and additional buildings to complement the main hall. Plans indicate that the outdoor area could host live music, events, and communal dining, making it a potential hotspot for locals and visitors alike.\",\"P: While securing city approval marks a major milestone, the project still has hurdles to clear, including obtaining necessary permits and finalizing construction plans. If all goes smoothly, The Foundry could bring a vibrant new energy to Walnut Creek’s dining and entertainment scene.\",\"P: For Bay Area food lovers, this is an exciting development worth watching. Whether it’s enjoying a freshly baked pastry, sipping on a fine glass of wine, or discovering a new favorite dish, The Foundry promises to be a culinary destination that transforms downtown Walnut Creek into a must-visit food and social experience.\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI: WEEKEND\",\"LI: WIN TIX\",\"LI: NEWSLETTER\",\"LI: FREE MUSEUM DAYS\",\"LI: ADD EVENT\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: 80,000 Free Tulips Are Coming to SF’s Union Square (2025)\",\"LI: SF’s Biggest Rooftop “Holi” Festival of Colors (2025)\",\"LI: Grand Opening of SF’s New 10,000 sqft “Museum of Failure” (Fisherman’s Wharf)\",\"LI: 2025 San Francisco Sail Grand Prix (March 22-23)\",\"LI: SF’s Easter In the Park \\u0026 Hunky Jesus Contest 2025 (Dolores Park)\",\"LI: Castro Night Market (SF)\",\"LI: 2025 Holi Festival at City Center (San Ramon)\",\"LI: 2025 Oakland Restaurant Week (March 20-30)\",\"LI: SF’s 2025 Cherry Blossom Festival (April 12-20)\",\"LI: SF’s “Women in Transit” Multimedia Concert feat.

Juicy is a queer, Southern college kid, already grappling with some serious questions of identity, when the ghost of his father shows up in their backyard, demanding that Juicy avenge his murder. It feels like a familiar story to Juicy, well-versed in Hamlet’s woes. What’s different is Juicy himself, a sensitive and self-aware young Black man trying to break the cycles of trauma and violence in service of his own liberation. From an uproarious family barbecue emerges a compelling examination of love and loss, pain and joy.

Initially planned for summer 2025, with hopes of being open for Pride Month, the theater is now expected to open at the earliest in fall 2025.\",\"P: The delay is tied to the installation of new lighting and sound systems, which require an upgraded power source. PG\\u0026E’s timeline for providing this service remains uncertain, leaving the project in a holding pattern. Another Planet Entertainment, which is managing the renovation, has indicated that while there are multiple options for securing power, the process remains outside their control.\",\"P: The delay impacts not only the theater but also local businesses that had anticipated an economic boost from increased foot traffic. The Castro Theatre has historically hosted major events, including portions of the Frameline film festival, which last took place at the venue in 2023.\",\"P: In addition to the theater’s delay, nearby businesses in the Castro Theatre building are also facing uncertainty. Castro Coffee Company and an adjacent nail salon remain in negotiations with the building’s landlord, the Nasser family, over lease renewals. The outcome of these negotiations could affect the stability of businesses that contribute to the neighborhood’s daytime economy.\",\"P: Local business leaders have emphasized the importance of maintaining the area’s vibrancy and hope for a resolution that supports both tenants and the surrounding community. While the theater’s next possible opening window falls between late 2025 and early 2026, the ultimate timeline remains dependent on power upgrades and construction progress.\",\"P: In addition, SF Gate has noted that the renovations are expected to cost more than double its initial budget of $15 million. Another Planet Entertainment projects that the renovations will likely cost in excess of $35 million which include a new HVAC system, a projector, a new film screen, a newer, larger organ, plus the electrical upgrades.\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI:

We also advise that you show up ready to go in your purrlates workout outfit, as we only have one restroom for changing and to bring a water bottle just in case you get parched during your session. *It is optional to bring your own mat, but we will be providing clean pilates mats as well.\",\"P: About KitTea Cat Lounge \\u0026 Cafe\",\"Purroud to be the first established cat cafe in the USA and the only cat cafe in San Francisco, CA. KitTea turned into a cat sanctuary in 2020 to provide high-quality care to our permanent resident rescue felines and feature cats from rescues in order to socialize and find them homes at each cat’s own pace.\",\"P: We like to think of a visit in our Cat Lounge as spa-like; a massage without the massage (unless you get Tippi on your lap). The process is akin to buying a ticket for a concert, but the band is 20-ish cats and the singing is much better than you’d expect.\",\"P: Upcoming Special Events | Weekly Pricing\",\"P: Getting to KitTea\",\"KitTea is conveniently located at 1266 Valencia Street in the vibrant Mission District. We’re a short walk from BART and MUNI at 24th and Mission (3 minute walk) and there is street/metered parking within walking distance.\",\"P: About Your Teacher: Robin discovered pilates in 2011, a few years after being hit by a car. Not only did she find it to be the most effective physical rehabilitation for her injuries, it also dramatically improved her overall well being. Her teaching promotes internally-focused movement while de-emphasizing aesthetics. She understands that movement is not one-size-fits-all and strives to help her students discover what works best for their unique bodies.\",\"P: In addition to being KitTea’s mew purrlates teacher, she also teaches down the street at EHS (without cats). There you can challenge yourself on one of their many reformers.\",\"P: When she’s not teaching she can be found selling property and riding bikes around San Francisco and Marin, or trapped under a very opinionated 9-year old tuxie.\",\"P: \",\"P: Disclaimer: Please double check event information with the event organizer as events can be canceled, details can change after they are added to our calendar, and errors do occur.\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI: WEEKEND\",\"LI: WIN TIX\",\"LI: NEWSLETTER\",\"LI: FREE MUSEUM DAYS\",\"LI: ADD EVENT\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: Weekday and Weekend Cat Lounge Visits (55 min.) = $28 per purrson\",\"LI: Mewvie Nights (90 min.) = $32 per purrson – select Saturday nights\",\"LI: Purrlates (30-40 min.) = $38 per purrson – select Friday nights\",\"LI: Cello and Chill (with Cats) Concert = $35 per purrson – select Friday nights\",\"LI: Wed 3/19 Cat Pilates (Purrlates) with 20+ Adorable Cats (SF’s Cat Cafe)\",\"LI: 80,000 Free Tulips Are Coming to SF’s Union Square (2025)\",\"LI: SF’s Biggest Rooftop “Holi” Festival of Colors (2025)\",\"LI: Grand Opening of SF’s New 10,000 sqft “Museum of Failure” (Fisherman’s Wharf)\",\"LI: 2025 San Francisco Sail Grand Prix (March 22-23)\",\"LI: SF’s Easter In the Park \\u0026 Hunky Jesus Contest 2025 (Dolores Park)\",\"LI: Castro Night Market (SF)\",\"LI: 2025 Holi Festival at City Center (San Ramon)\",\"LI: Spring Equinox Inner Sunset Art Walk (SF)\",\"LI: 2025 Oakland Restaurant Week (March 20-30)\",\"LI: SF’s 2025 Cherry Blossom Festival (April 12-20)\",\"LI: SF’s St. Patrick’s Day Celebrations 2025\",\"LI: San Francisco April Festivals \\u0026 Street Fairs 2025\",\"LI: Free Museum Days in San Francisco + Bay Area (2025)\",\"LI: 45-ft Statue of Giant Naked Woman Now Coming to SF’s Embarcadero\",\"LI: March 13 Marks Final Day for Cars on SF’s Great Highway\",\"LI: How to Get the NY Times for Free (Updated for 2025)\",\"LI: San Francisco March Festivals \\u0026 Street Fairs 2025\",\"LI: Daly City’s New Huge Korean Market \\u0026 Food Hall Opens March 2025\",\"LI: Massive European-Style Food Hall Planned for East Bay\",\"LI: SF’s Getting a Brand New 5-Acre Embarcadero Waterfront Park\",\"LI: Art \\u0026 Museums\",\"LI: Charity \\u0026 Volunteering\",\"LI: Club / DJ\",\"LI: Comedy\",\"LI: Eating \\u0026 Drinking\",\"LI: Fairs \\u0026 Festivals\",\"LI: Free Stuff\",\"LI: Fun \\u0026 Games\",\"LI: Geek Event\",\"LI: Kids \\u0026 Families\",\"LI: Lectures \\u0026 Workshops\",\"LI: Literature\",\"LI: Live Music\",\"LI: Movies\",\"LI: Shopping \\u0026 Fashion\",\"LI: Sports \\u0026 Fitness\",\"LI: Theater \\u0026 Performance\",\"LI: East Bay\",\"LI: North Bay\",\"LI: Peninsula\",\"LI: San Francisco\",\"LI: South Bay\",\"LI: About Funcheap\",\"LI: Advertise\",\"LI: Press Room\",\"LI: Jobs \\u0026 Internships\",\"LI: Terms of Service\",\"LI: DMCA Requests\",\"LI: Do Not Sell My Personal Information\",\"LI: Privacy Policy\",\"LI: Contact Us\",\"\",\"URL: https://sf.funcheap.com/city-guide/daly-citys-huge-korean-market-food-hall-opens-march-2025/\",\"H1: Daly City’s New Huge Korean Market \\u0026 Food Hall Opens March 2025\",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: A Complete Korean Food Experience\",\"H3: Grand Opening Details\",\"H3: Most Popular Upcoming Events\",\"H3: Sign Up For Funcheap Emails\",\"H3: Most Popular City Guides\",\"H3: Categories\",\"H3: Locations\",\"H3: Follow Us\",\"P: Bay Area food lovers have a new destination to explore as Jagalchi officially opens at Serramonte Center in Daly City on March 28, 2025.

Forward\",\"P: San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors has approved a plan to revamp Embarcadero Plaza and the adjacent Sue Bierman Park as part of ongoing efforts to boost Downtown’s public spaces. The project is a collaboration between the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, Office of Economic and Workforce Development, real estate developer BXP, and the Downtown SF Partnership.\",\"P: The redevelopment will merge Embarcadero Plaza, South Embarcadero, and Sue Bierman Park into a single 5-acre park — double the size of Union Square. The new design, led by architecture firm HOK, will replace the current concrete layout with lush green spaces, walking paths, and recreational areas. Plans include sculpture gardens, food trucks, volleyball courts, picnic spots, and a bandshell stage for live performances.\",\"P: BXP will contribute approximately $2.5 million toward the design, while city agencies will seek public and private funding to cover the remainder of the estimated $25-$30 million cost.\",\"P: Community feedback will play a key role in shaping the park’s final design. The first public meeting will take place on Thursday, March 6, 2025 from 5 to 7 p.m. at 4 Embarcadero Center.\",\"P: The project aims to create a more inviting space along San Francisco’s waterfront, supporting the city’s broader Downtown revitalization efforts.\",\"P: Over the past year, the City has invested significant effort into reinvigorating Embarcadero Plaza.\",\"P: \",\"P: Read more at San Francisco Recreation and Park Department\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI: WEEKEND\",\"LI: WIN TIX\",\"LI: NEWSLETTER\",\"LI: FREE MUSEUM DAYS\",\"LI: ADD EVENT\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: In November 2023, Rec and Park installed two pop-up padel courts, with a third court installed in October 2024.

Funcheap’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Funcheap’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Funcheap may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\",\"P: Funcheap also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments and entering contests.

These third party companies who sponsor contests and content on Funcheap have their own respective privacy policies if you choose to provide them with your information on the third party website.\",\"P: Funcheap takes your privacy very seriously. We do not sell your personal information.

The Sisters use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency, and guilt that chain the human spirit. To learn more about the Sisters, visit their website, www.thesisters.org, or their Facebook and Instagram pages.\",\"P: Muni Stop: J line – 18th and Church or Right of Way/20th Street Station\",\"Bus Routes: 14R, 33\",\"P: Please no glass or smoking in Mission Dolores Park.\",\"P: Disclaimer: Please double check event information with the event organizer as events can be canceled, details can change after they are added to our calendar, and errors do occur.\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI: WEEKEND\",\"LI: WIN TIX\",\"LI: NEWSLETTER\",\"LI: FREE MUSEUM DAYS\",\"LI: ADD EVENT\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: 80,000 Free Tulips Are Coming to SF’s Union Square (2025)\",\"LI: SF’s Biggest Rooftop “Holi” Festival of Colors (2025)\",\"LI: Grand Opening of SF’s New 10,000 sqft “Museum of Failure” (Fisherman’s Wharf)\",\"LI: 2025 San Francisco Sail Grand Prix (March 22-23)\",\"LI: SF’s Easter In the Park \\u0026 Hunky Jesus Contest 2025 (Dolores Park)\",\"LI: Castro Night Market (SF)\",\"LI: 2025 Holi Festival at City Center (San Ramon)\",\"LI: 2025 Oakland Restaurant Week (March 20-30)\",\"LI: SF’s 2025 Cherry Blossom Festival (April 12-20)\",\"LI: SF’s “Women in Transit” Multimedia Concert feat.

City officials relocated the installation after concerns that its weight could damage Union Square’s granite tiles.\",\"P: “R-Evolution” is part of Cochrane’s triptych honoring female empowerment and was first displayed at Burning Man in 2015. The towering steel structure features geodesic panels and stainless steel mesh, with movable components and LED lighting designed to simulate breathing. The sculpture weighs 16,000 pounds, with an additional 16,000 pounds of steel anchoring plates.\",\"P: The sculpture was initially set for Union Square, where officials hoped it would help revitalize the area following economic downturns. However, just days before its scheduled assembly, concerns arose about potential damage to the plaza’s tiles and underground garage structure, prompting a search for a new location. After further engineering reviews, the San Francisco Arts Commission and the Recreation and Park Department approved Embarcadero Plaza as the new site.\",\"P: A public unveiling event is expected to accompany the installation. While details are still being finalized, event organizers plan to include local artists in the celebration, particularly those who typically sell their wares in the plaza. The sculpture will be installed for at least six months, with the possibility of an extension.\",\"P: With its prominent location near the Ferry Building, R-Evolution is poised to become a new focal point along the Embarcadero, drawing visitors and helping breathe new life into San Francisco’s downtown arts scene.\",\"P: Related Article: 45-ft Statue of Giant Naked Woman Coming to Union Square –  1/9/2025\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI: WEEKEND\",\"LI: WIN TIX\",\"LI: NEWSLETTER\",\"LI: FREE MUSEUM DAYS\",\"LI: ADD EVENT\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: 80,000 Free Tulips Are Coming to SF’s Union Square (2025)\",\"LI: SF’s Biggest Rooftop “Holi” Festival of Colors (2025)\",\"LI: Grand Opening of SF’s New 10,000 sqft “Museum of Failure” (Fisherman’s Wharf)\",\"LI: 2025 San Francisco Sail Grand Prix (March 22-23)\",\"LI: SF’s Easter In the Park \\u0026 Hunky Jesus Contest 2025 (Dolores Park)\",\"LI: Castro Night Market (SF)\",\"LI: 2025 Holi Festival at City Center (San Ramon)\",\"LI: 2025 Oakland Restaurant Week (March 20-30)\",\"LI: SF’s 2025 Cherry Blossom Festival (April 12-20)\",\"LI: Spring Equinox Inner Sunset Art Walk (SF)\",\"LI: SF’s St. Patrick’s Day Celebrations 2025\",\"LI: San Francisco April Festivals \\u0026 Street Fairs 2025\",\"LI: Free Museum Days in San Francisco + Bay Area (2025)\",\"LI: 45-ft Statue of Giant Naked Woman Now Coming to SF’s Embarcadero\",\"LI: March 13 Marks Final Day for Cars on SF’s Great Highway\",\"LI: How to Get the NY Times for Free (Updated for 2025)\",\"LI: San Francisco March Festivals \\u0026 Street Fairs 2025\",\"LI: Daly City’s New Huge Korean Market \\u0026 Food Hall Opens March 2025\",\"LI: Massive European-Style Food Hall Planned for East Bay\",\"LI: SF’s Getting a Brand New 5-Acre Embarcadero Waterfront Park\",\"LI: Art \\u0026 Museums\",\"LI: Charity \\u0026 Volunteering\",\"LI: Club / DJ\",\"LI: Comedy\",\"LI: Eating \\u0026 Drinking\",\"LI: Fairs \\u0026 Festivals\",\"LI: Free Stuff\",\"LI: Fun \\u0026 Games\",\"LI: Geek Event\",\"LI: Kids \\u0026 Families\",\"LI: Lectures \\u0026 Workshops\",\"LI: Literature\",\"LI: Live Music\",\"LI: Movies\",\"LI: Shopping \\u0026 Fashion\",\"LI: Sports \\u0026 Fitness\",\"LI: Theater \\u0026 Performance\",\"LI: East Bay\",\"LI: North Bay\",\"LI: Peninsula\",\"LI: San Francisco\",\"LI: South Bay\",\"LI: About Funcheap\",\"LI: Advertise\",\"LI: Press Room\",\"LI: Jobs \\u0026 Internships\",\"LI: Terms of Service\",\"LI: DMCA Requests\",\"LI: Do Not Sell My Personal Information\",\"LI: Privacy Policy\",\"LI: Contact Us\",\"\",\"URL: https://sf.funcheap.com/american-tulip-day-100000-pickyourown-tulips-union-square-sf/\",\"H1: 80,000 Free Tulips Are Coming to SF’s Union Square (2025)\",\"H2: Other Events on This Day\",\"H2: Saturday, March 22, 2025\",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: Free / Learn More\",\"H3: Most Popular Upcoming Events\",\"H3: Sign Up For Funcheap Emails\",\"H3: Most Popular City Guides\",\"H3: Categories\",\"H3: Locations\",\"H3: Follow Us\",\"P: Flower Bulb Day is coming to America.

Upper Great Highway as the city moves forward with its plan to convert the roadway into a park. Approved by voters through Proposition K in the November election, the decision reflects a shift toward prioritizing public recreational spaces over car traffic.\",\"P: While a lawsuit challenging the validity of the vote is still pending, city officials are proceeding with the transformation. The suit argues that such decisions should be made by local government officials rather than voters, but for now, the plan to close the road remains in place.\",\"P: The upcoming 2-mile-long, 43-acre park is expected to open on April 12 and will feature various amenities, including art installations, lounge spaces, event seating, skating areas, bike racks, outdoor fitness equipment, and a nature exploration area. The San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department is also engaging the public in a naming contest for the new park, with submissions accepted until Sunday, March 16, at 5 p.m.\",\"P: The decision to close the Upper Great Highway to traffic has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters see the change as a significant step toward expanding public green spaces and enhancing recreational opportunities. However, many west-side residents opposed the closure, citing concerns about increased traffic congestion in surrounding neighborhoods. Data from Election Map SF indicates that about 15,000 vehicles traveled the highway daily, leading critics to worry about the impact on already busy streets nearby.\",\"P: Despite opposition, city officials are committed to moving forward with the park’s development. The transformation of the Upper Great Highway marks a major shift in how San Francisco prioritizes urban space, aiming to provide more areas for outdoor activities while addressing long-term environmental and community needs.\",\"P: Hat Tip: KRON4\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"LI: MENU\",\"LI: ALL EVENTS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: FREE\",\"LI: TODAY\",\"LI: WEEKEND\",\"LI: WIN TIX\",\"LI: NEWSLETTER\",\"LI: FREE MUSEUM DAYS\",\"LI: ADD EVENT\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: 80,000 Free Tulips Are Coming to SF’s Union Square (2025)\",\"LI: SF’s Biggest Rooftop “Holi” Festival of Colors (2025)\",\"LI: Grand Opening of SF’s New 10,000 sqft “Museum of Failure” (Fisherman’s Wharf)\",\"LI: 2025 San Francisco Sail Grand Prix (March 22-23)\",\"LI: SF’s Easter In the Park \\u0026 Hunky Jesus Contest 2025 (Dolores Park)\",\"LI: Castro Night Market (SF)\",\"LI: 2025 Holi Festival at City Center (San Ramon)\",\"LI: 2025 Oakland Restaurant Week (March 20-30)\",\"LI: SF’s 2025 Cherry Blossom Festival (April 12-20)\",\"LI: SF’s “Women in Transit” Multimedia Concert feat.

What does she want? When will she leave? Only The Woman in the Yard knows. From Blumhouse, the most successful global brand in horror, comes a new original chiller starring BAFTA and SAG nominee Danielle Deadwyler (Till, The Harder They Fall, The Piano Lesson) as Ramona, a woman crippled by grief after she survives a car accident that takes her husband (Russell Hornsby; BMF, Fences). Seriously injured, Ramona now must care for their 14-year-old son (Peyton Jackson; Respect, American Refugee) and 6-year-old-daughter (Estella Kahiha; Will Trent, BMF), alone in her rural farmhouse. Then one day the woman takes form in their yard. Ramona assumes the woman (Okwui Okpokwasili; The Exorcist: Believer, Julie Taymor’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream) is lost or demented, but as the woman creeps nearer and nearer to the house, it becomes clear she is no ordinary figure and her intentions are anything but peaceful. Now Ramona must rally to protect herself and her children from the grasp of the woman who simply won’t leave them alone. The Woman in the Yard is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, Jungle Cruise), who recently directed Deadwyler in the upcoming action thriller Carry On. The film is written by first-time feature screenwriter Sam Stefanak.\",\"P: Levon Cade left behind a decorated military career in the black ops to live a simple life working construction. But when his boss’s daughter, who is like family to him, is taken by human traffickers, his search to bring her home uncovers a world of corruption far greater than he ever could have imagined.\",\"P: “The Amateur,” an action-packed espionage-thriller from 20th Century Studios starring Oscar® winner Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), opens in theaters nationwide April 11, 2025. Charlie Heller (Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. “The Amateur” is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami Malek, Joel B. Michaels, with JJ Hook serving as executive producer.\",\"P: \",\"P: Day Market / Night Drive In\",\"P: 5650 N 55th Ave,\",\"Glendale, AZ 85301\",\"P: (623) 939-9715\",\"P: Copyright 2025 West Wind

From Blumhouse, the most successful global brand in horror, comes a new original chiller starring BAFTA and SAG nominee Danielle Deadwyler (Till, The Harder They Fall, The Piano Lesson) as Ramona, a woman crippled by grief after she survives a car accident that takes her husband (Russell Hornsby; BMF, Fences). Seriously injured, Ramona now must care for their 14-year-old son (Peyton Jackson; Respect, American Refugee) and 6-year-old-daughter (Estella Kahiha; Will Trent, BMF), alone in her rural farmhouse. Then one day the woman takes form in their yard. Ramona assumes the woman (Okwui Okpokwasili; The Exorcist: Believer, Julie Taymor’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream) is lost or demented, but as the woman creeps nearer and nearer to the house, it becomes clear she is no ordinary figure and her intentions are anything but peaceful. Now Ramona must rally to protect herself and her children from the grasp of the woman who simply won’t leave them alone. The Woman in the Yard is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, Jungle Cruise), who recently directed Deadwyler in the upcoming action thriller Carry On. The film is written by first-time feature screenwriter Sam Stefanak.\",\"P: Levon Cade left behind a decorated military career in the black ops to live a simple life working construction. But when his boss’s daughter, who is like family to him, is taken by human traffickers, his search to bring her home uncovers a world of corruption far greater than he ever could have imagined.\",\"P: “The Amateur,” an action-packed espionage-thriller from 20th Century Studios starring Oscar® winner Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), opens in theaters nationwide April 11, 2025. Charlie Heller (Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. “The Amateur” is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami Malek, Joel B. Michaels, with JJ Hook serving as executive producer.\",\"P: Day Market / Night Drive In\",\"P: 1611 Solano Way,\",\"Concord, CA 94520\",\"P: (925) 687-6445\",\"P: Copyright 2025 West Wind Drive-In \\u0026 Public Market Privacy Policy Terms of Use\",\"LI: BUY TICKETS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: COMING SOON \\u0026 PRE-SALE TICKETS\",\"LI: CONCESSIONS\",\"LI: GIFT CARDS\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: ABOUT US\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: LASER EXTREME\",\"LI: PUBLIC MARKET\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: About Us\",\"LI: Contact\",\"LI: Job Opportunities\",\"LI: Privacy Policy\",\"LI: Terms and Conditions\",\"LI: Drive In Events\",\"LI: Host An Event\",\"LI: Birthday Parties\",\"LI: Drive-In FAQs\",\"LI: Concessions\",\"LI: Laser Extreme\",\"LI: About Movie Perks\",\"LI: My Account\",\"LI: Movie Perks FAQs\",\"LI: Mobile App\",\"LI: Sign Up / Log in\",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: \",\"LI: GLENDALE, AZ\",\"LI: CONCORD, CA\",\"LI: SAN JOSE, CA\",\"LI: SACRAMENTO, CA\",\"LI: LAS VEGAS, NV\",\"LI: RENO, NV\",\"\",\"URL: https://www.westwinddi.com/locations/capitol\",\"H1: Now Playing in | San Jose, CA\",\"H2: The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie\",\"H2: In the Lost Lands\",\"H2: Last Breath\",\"H2: Novocaine\",\"H2: Mickey 17\",\"H2: The Monkey\",\"H2: Captain America: Brave New World\",\"H2: Coming Soon\",\"H2: Public Market\",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: \",\"H3: The Woman in the Yard\",\"H3: A Working Man\",\"H3: The Amateur\",\"P: Laser\",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: \",\"P: A lone, spectral woman shrouded entirely in black appears on a family’s front lawn without explanation and warns them “today’s the day.” Where did she come from?
